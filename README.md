#### What is a PWA?

> "PWA is the supremacy of web development" - SENA, Matheus

PWA (Progressive Web App) is a website that has ability to work as a app, with PWA we were able to do amazing things that until recently was impossible in the web development environment, for example:
- Push notification
- Splash Screen
- Access to mobile API like camera
**AND IN MY OPINION THE MOST SPECTACULAR FUNCTIONALY**
- PWA's can work offline!
